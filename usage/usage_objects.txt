Usage:

  vdb objects [OPTIONS]

Options:

  -h --help                 Print this info
  -v --verbose              Print as much as possible (debugging)
  -w --warnings             Show warnings (suppressed by default)
  -E --errors-off           Do not show any error messages

  All object types get printed to stdout in the following form (CSV):
  
    'OBJECT_TYPE_TUPLE,OBJECT_GEOMETRY,OBJECT_TYPE_NAME'

  Where 'OBJECT_TYPE_TUPLE' is 'A.B.C.D' and:

    A = DOMAIN
    B = OBJECT_KIND
    C = (category)
    D = (subcategory)
  
Examples:

  Shows just the object type values with 'POINT' geometry: 
  
    $ vdb enums | grep ',POINT,'
